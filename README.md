 # Edge and contour Detection
I think thatâ€™s a good start with edge detection, contours, and the different manipulations and steps we can add to the process. 
I encourage you to play around with the parameters, thresholds and different methods of edge detection.

# Face Detection Model

Face detection is a computer vision techique that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images.
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. 
OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.
