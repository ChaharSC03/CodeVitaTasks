Contour Detection

Contour : when all boundary points of an object are join then we get Contour.
typically a specific contour refers to boundary values or pixels that have the same color and intensity.

OpenCV provides two simple Functions:
1. findContours()
2.drawContours()

there are two differen algorithms for contour detection:

1. CHAIN_APPROX_NONE
2. CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE


We will follow few steps for detecting and drawing contours:

1. Read the image and convert it to grayscale format

2. first always apply binary threshold or canny edge detection to grayscale image 

Thresholding turns the border of the object in the image completely white, with all pixels having the same intensity.

3. Finding Contour using findContours() function to detect the contour in the image

4. Once contour have been identified , use drawContours() function to overlay the contour on the original image
